What I have so far
	Iâ€™ve decided to rework my original idea, and create a program that will calculate the profit margins of items. 
The program will take the cost of materials, cost of listing and seller fees, cost of shipping materials, and cost of shipping fee as input. 
The program can then either generate a price for the item that will be 1.5 times the cost of materials, or calculate the profit margins of the user entered price. 
Here is the code I have written so far, without any GUI elements. I think it will be easier for me to understand how to code the GUI aspects if I already know the main function of the program. 
I may go back in later and add preset buttons for materials that I use frequently, such as individual prices of shipping items

materialsCost= 0
while materialsCost <1000000:
    materialsNum=input("Would you like to add a material price?")
    if materialsNum == "Yes" or materialsNum== "yes":
        cost=float(input("Enter the cost of one material"))
        materialsCost= materialsCost + cost
    else:
        materialsCost= materialsCost
        break
        

listing= float(input("Enter the cost of all listing fees for this item"))
seller= float(input("Enter the cost of all seller fees for this item."))

box= float(input("Enter the cost of the shipping box"))
packMaterials= float(input("Enter the cost of all packing materials"))
shipping= float(input("Enter the estimated shipping fee"))

totalFees= materialsCost+listing+seller+box+packMaterials+shipping
print("The total cost to produce this item is ", totalFees)

Profit150= totalFees *1.5
print ("To price the item 150% of the cost to produce, the price would be ", Profit150)

userPrice= float(input("Enter what you would like to price this item as"))
profitMarg= materialsCost/userPrice
print("If you priced this item at ", userPrice, "your profit margin would be ", profitMarg)
